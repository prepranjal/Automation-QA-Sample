This repository contains two complete end-to-end automation frameworks developed in Python and Java. Both projects follow industry-standard design patterns and demonstrate expertise in UI and API automation, scalable architecture, and BDD implementation.

✔ Python Automation Framework  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- PyTest  
- Behave (BDD)  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- Utilities for waits, logging, reporting, data handling  
- Config-driven execution  
- API integration via REST libraries

✔ Java Automation Framework  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- TestNG  
- Cucumber BDD  
- Hybrid/POM framework  
- Reusable page components  
- Data-driven & keyword-driven implementation  
- Extent/Allure reporting support

Both frameworks follow clean coding practices with modular structure, CI/CD compatibility, and easy execution for regression, smoke, and cross-browser testing.
